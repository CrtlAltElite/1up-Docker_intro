A Dockerfile is a script made up of various commands and arguments that specify the operating system, libraries, and other files needed to create a Docker image. The image, in turn, can be used to instantiate containers. Below is an explanation of the commonly used sections and how to make decisions about what to include:

### Comments
- Starts with `#`.
- Used to add comments to your Dockerfile for better readability.

Dockerfile
# This is a comment


### FROM
- Specifies the base image to use.
- Required as the first non-comment instruction in the Dockerfile.

Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8


### WORKDIR
- Sets the working directory inside the container.
- Any following `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, or `ADD` commands will be executed in this directory.

Dockerfile
WORKDIR /app


### COPY
- Copies files or directories from the host machine to the container.

Dockerfile
COPY . .


### ADD
- Similar to `COPY`, but can also handle remote URLs and tarball extraction.

Dockerfile
ADD my_script.tar.gz /app


### RUN
- Executes a command inside the container.

Dockerfile
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt


### ENV
- Sets environment variables in the container.

Dockerfile
ENV MY_ENV_VAR=my_value


### EXPOSE
- Informs Docker that the container will listen on specified network ports at runtime.

Dockerfile
EXPOSE 80


### CMD
- Specifies the default command that will be executed when the container starts.

Dockerfile
CMD ["python", "app.py"]


### ENTRYPOINT
- Similar to `CMD`, but used when you want the container to behave as an executable.

Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]


### VOLUME
- Creates a mount point and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes from the native host or other containers.

Dockerfile
VOLUME /data


### USER
- Sets the username or UID to use when running the image.

Dockerfile
USER myuser


### MAINTAINER (deprecated)
- Specifies the author of the Dockerfile.
- Deprecated in favor of using labels.

Dockerfile
MAINTAINER your-email@example.com


### LABEL
- Adds metadata to the image, such as version or maintainer info.

Dockerfile
LABEL version="1.0"


### ARG
- Defines a build-time variable.

Dockerfile
ARG MY_ARG


### ONBUILD
- Adds a trigger instruction to be executed later, when the image is used as the base for another build.

Dockerfile
ONBUILD COPY . .


### Deciding on Options

1. **Base Image**: Choose a base image that provides just what you need to run your application. For example, use `python:3.8-slim` instead of `python:3.8` if you don't need the additional packages.
   
2. **Order**: Put instructions that are least likely to change (like `FROM`) at the top to leverage Docker's build cache.

3. **Security**: Use official or well-maintained images as the base image to ensure security. Also, set user permissions appropriately.

4. **Cleanup**: In the `RUN` steps, remove any temporary files or caches to reduce the image size.

5. **Documentation**: Use comments and labels to document your Dockerfile.

6. **Environment Variables**: Use `ENV` for variables that should be set in the running container and `ARG` for variables that affect the build process.

By understanding the purpose of each command, you can make more informed decisions about what to include in your Dockerfile, which in turn helps in creating optimized, secure, and efficient Docker images.
